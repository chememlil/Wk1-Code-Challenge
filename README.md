How it works

Gross Salary Calculation:

The gross salary is calculated by adding the basic salary and benefits.
PAYE (Tax) Calculation:

The PAYE is calculated based on the gross salary using a tiered tax rate:
10% for income up to 24,000
15% for income from 24,001 to 40,000
20% for income from 40,001 to 60,000
25% for income from 60,001 to 80,000
30% for income above 80,000
NHIF Contributions:

The NHIF contribution is calculated based on the gross salary using predefined slabs.
NSSF Contributions:

The NSSF contribution is 6% of the gross salary.
Net Salary Calculation:

The net salary is calculated by subtracting the PAYE, NHIF, and NSSF from the gross salary.
